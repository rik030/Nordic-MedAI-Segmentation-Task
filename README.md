# Nordic-MedAI-Segmentation-Task
MedAI: Transparency in Medical Image Segmentation is a challenge held for the first time at the Nordic AI Meet that focuses on medical image segmentation and transparency in machine learning (ML)-based systems. The competition proposes three tasks to meet specific gastrointestinal image segmentation challenges collected from experts within the field, including two separate segmentation scenarios and one scenario on transparent ML systems. The latter emphasizes the need for explainable and interpretable ML algorithms. We provide a development dataset for the participants to train their ML models, tested on a concealed test dataset.

This repository contains codes for two of the segmentation tasks. You can find our paper at https://doi.org/10.5617/nmi.9145
